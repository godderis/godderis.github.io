I'm a physicist working on the evolution of continental weathering at various temporal and spatial scales. Most of my contributions are dealing with the connection between continental weathering and the long term climate evolution, and with the response of modern weathering system to the ongoing climate changes. My investigation tools are numerical models. I developed the WITCH model, simulating the weathering processes at the scale of small watersheds, and the GEOCLIM model (together with Yannick Donnadieu, Guillaume Le Hir, and Pierre Maffre) allowing the simulation of the multi-million year evolution of the Earth surface.
